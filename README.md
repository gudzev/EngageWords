# EngageWords - English Words Quiz   
 
This web app displays words in English and their translations in Serbian.   
User needs to guess what the word means, and if he does, he'll get another word to guess.   
 
EngageWords utilizes localStorage to save data. Better approach would be to    
create a database with user accounts, words, and save scores there.     
This would make possible things like leaderboards for further player engagement.   
 
Technologies used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
